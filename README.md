# Deloitte Job Simulation (Forage)

This repository contains my work from the **Deloitte Technology Consulting Job Simulation** hosted on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/).  

The program simulated real-world consulting scenarios where I applied **data analysis, visualization, and problem-solving skills** to deliver insights for Deloitte‚Äôs client, **Daikibo Industrials**.
